### ðŸŽ® **IF Block Exercise: Candy Collection Game in **

#### **Instructions:**

You will write code that checks if the player has a certain number of candies, and prints different messages depending on the number.

### 1. **Scenario 1:**

You have **15 candies**. Write a program that checks if you have **10 or more candies**. If you do, the program should print **"You win a prize!"**.

#### **Hint:**

* Use an `if` block to check if the candies are greater than or equal to 10.
* Print the message if true.


---

### 2. **Scenario 2:**

Now, you have **5 candies**. Write a program that checks if you have **less than 10 candies**. If you do, the program should print **"Keep trying!"**.

#### **Hint:**

* Use an `if` block to check if candies are **less than 10**.
* Print the message if true.


---

### 3. **Scenario 3:**

You have **20 candies**. Write a program that checks if you have **exactly 20 candies**. If true, the program should print **"You are the candy master!"**.

#### **Hint:**

* Use `==` to check if you have exactly 20 candies.


---

### 4. **Bonus Scenario:**

Now, let's combine everything! You have **10 candies**. Write a program that checks:

* If you have **10 or more candies**, print **"You win a prize!"**
* If you have **less than 10 candies**, print **"Keep trying!"**

#### **Hint:**

* Use an `else` block to handle the second condition.


* Experiment with different numbers for `candies` to see how the program behaves.
* Add more conditions like checking for more than 50 candies or having exactly 0 candies.

This activity should help solidify the concept of **if statements** and how they work in a simple and interactive way! Would you like a suggestion for an even more complex challenge?
