### üéÆ **IF Block Exercise: Candy Collection Game in **

#### **Instructions:**

You will write code that checks if the player has a certain number of candies, and prints different messages depending on the number.

### 1. **Scenario 1:**

You have **15 candies**. Write a program that checks if you have **10 or more candies**. If you do, the program should print **"You win a prize!"**.

#### **Hint:**

* Use an `if` block to check if the candies are greater than or equal to 10.
* Print the message if true.


---

### 2. **Scenario 2:**

Now, you have **5 candies**. Write a program that checks if you have **less than 10 candies**. If you do, the program should print **"Keep trying!"**.

#### **Hint:**

* Use an `if` block to check if candies are **less than 10**.
* Print the message if true.


---

### 3. **Scenario 3:**

You have **20 candies**. Write a program that checks if you have **exactly 20 candies**. If true, the program should print **"You are the candy master!"**.

#### **Hint:**

* Use `==` to check if you have exactly 20 candies.


---

### 4. **Bonus Scenario:**

Now, let's combine everything! You have **10 candies**. Write a program that checks:

* If you have **10 or more candies**, print **"You win a prize!"**
* If you have **less than 10 candies**, print **"Keep trying!"**

#### **Hint:**

* Use an `else` block to handle the second condition.


* Experiment with different numbers for `candies` to see how the program behaves.
* Add more conditions like checking for more than 50 candies or having exactly 0 candies.





### LISTS EXERCISES

### üéÆ 1. You Have Some Game Scores

You played 3 levels in a game. Your scores were 100, 200, and 150.
Write a program that stores these scores in a list and prints the second score.

**Hint:**

* Use a list to store the scores.
* Use indexing to print the second item (remember: Python starts counting at 0).

---

### üèÜ 2. Add a New High Score

You just got a new score of 250 in your game.
Add it to your existing score list: `[100, 200, 150]`.

**Hint:**

* Use the `.append()` method to add the score.
* Print the updated list.

---

### üéí 3. Your Inventory

Your inventory has: `"sword"`, `"potion"`, and `"shield"`.
You find a `"bow"` and want to add it to your inventory.
Then, you use the `"potion"` and want to remove it.

**Hint:**

* Use `.append()` to add.
* Use `.remove()` to take something out.

---

### üß† 4. Is the Game on the List?

You have these games: `["Minecraft", "Roblox", "Among Us"]`
Ask the user to type the name of a game.
If the game is in the list, print `"Yes, it's in your library!"`

**Hint:**

* Use `input()` to get the game.
* Use the `in` keyword in an `if` statement.

---

### üß± 5. Build a Level List

Create a list of 3 levels: `"Level 1"`, `"Level 2"`, `"Boss Level"`.
Print each level one by one.

**Hint:**

* Use a `for` loop to go through the list.

---

### üé≤ 6. Random Game Picker

You can't decide what to play!
You have: `["Mario", "Zelda", "Pokemon"]`
Write a program to randomly pick one.

**Hint:**

* Use `import random`
* Use `random.choice()` to select a game from the list.
