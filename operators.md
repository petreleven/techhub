### 🧮 **Comparing Numbers in Python**

In Python, we can **compare** numbers to see which one is bigger or smaller.

| Symbol | Meaning                      | Example  | What it says                        |
| :----: | :--------------------------- | :------- | :---------------------------------- |
|   `>`  | **Greater than**             | `5 > 3`  | “5 is bigger than 3” ✅              |
|   `<`  | **Less than**                | `2 < 6`  | “2 is smaller than 6” ✅             |

### 💡 Example

```python
age = 8

if age > 6:
    print("You are older than 6!")
```

This will print:

```
You are older than 6!
```
