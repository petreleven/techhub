# 🟦 Sub-domain 1: Core Values & Mission

### 1. What is your institution's mission, vision, and/or values?
**Your answer:**  
> to create interest among the youth in agriculture

### 2. How are gender and nutrition related to what you do at this institution?
**Your answer:**  
> we aim to spread information /importance of farming and agriculture to both boys and girls but we dont have any policy like keeping the ratio 1 to 1

### **Scores**
- **Gender:** 0  
- **Nutrition:** 0  

### **Rationale**
The mission does not explicitly mention gender or nutrition. Inclusion of boys and girls is described as a practice, not a formal principle. Nutrition is not linked to the institution's mission or values.

# 🟦 Sub-domain 2: Institutional Policies

### 1. Does your institution have a gender or nutrition policy/plan/strategy?
**Your answer:**  
> no

### 2. Describe key components of your gender or nutrition strategy.
**Your answer:**  
> we dont have policy — it’s an unwritten rule to spread information in a non-biased way

### 3. How have these components influenced implementation?
**Your answer:**  
> not much

### **Scores**
- **Gender:** 0  
- **Nutrition:** 0  

### **Rationale**
No formal or written policy exists. An unwritten rule does not meet minimum standards.
